# Creating my own programming language: Zark!

this is my first attempt to create a programming language.
this will be a lisp (*) dialect.

For the initial compiler/interpreter implementation I chose TS, since I have a lot of experience with it.

I will write a simple lisp interpreter, with REPL (*) (read, eval, print, loop)

## How does compilers work?

They are divided in three steps:

1. Lexer/Scanner (search for better name, probably lexer)
2. Eval
3. Print

Lexer will tokenize the source code, eval will read and produce the computation, then will print to console

I created a repo in github. Chose unlicense as my license, so it's in public domain. nothing fancy. standar node project

First I create a wrapper around fs and readline in the `os` folder

```ts
// file-reader.ts
import { readFileSync } from "fs"

export const readFile = (path: string) => readFileSync(path).toString()
```

```ts
// stdin-reader.ts
import { createInterface } from "readline"

const { stdin, stdout } = process

const { question } = createInterface({ input: stdin, output: stdout, })

export const prompt: Prompt = (input, exitCommand, callback) => {
  question(input, (answer) => {
    callback(answer)
    return exitCommand.test(answer) ? null : prompt(input, exitCommand, callback)
    // TODO: may cause stack overflow, since it's using recursion
  })
}

type Prompt = (promptText: string, exitCommand: RegExp, callback: PromptCallback) => void
type PromptCallback = (answer: string) => void
```

I've put the jest and tsconfig in a `config` folder

Also created a `compiler` folder where the main code will be.

To start a lexer, will create a `reader.ts` and test file.

The first part of the lexer will turn s-expressions into tokens.
I will create a function/procedure tokenize that takes a string and returns an array of nested strings:

```ts
export const tokenize = () => {}
```

turn this `(+ 1 2)` into this `['(','+', '1', '2', ')']`

turn this `(+ 1 2)` into this `['+', 1, 2]`
