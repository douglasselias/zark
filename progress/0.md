# Creating my own programming language: Zark!

this is my first attempt to create a programming language.
this will be a lisp (*) dialect.

For the initial compiler/interpreter implementation I chose TS, since I have a lot of experience with it.

I will write a simple lisp interpreter, with REPL (*) (read, eval, print, loop)

## How does compilers work?

They are divided in three steps:

1. Lexer/Scanner (search for better name, probably lexer)
2. Eval
3. Print

Lexer will tokenize the source code, eval will read and produce the computation, then will print to console
