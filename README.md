- [] Add full line editing and command history support to your interpreter REPL. Many languages have a library/module that provide line editing support. Another option if your language supports it is to use an FFI (foreign function interface) to load and call directly into GNU readline, editline, or linenoise library. Add line editing interface code to readline.qx
